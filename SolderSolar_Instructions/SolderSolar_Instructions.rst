============

Design and instructions for a simple DIY solar powered torch.

Overview
-------
This is a very simple soldering kit to build a solar powered torch.
The unit has a small solar panel which recharges an ultra-capacitor.
There are two LEDs, one white and one red, which are powered by the energy in the ultra-capacitor.

The ultra-capacitor is 0.47F which stores enough charge for around 20 minutes of white light, or around 1 hour of red light.

This kit is designed as a **"Learn to Solder"** kit and as an introduction to **solar power**.

This kit can also be used as a small power supply for other projects (requiring a 3-5.5V power supply). This could be used for very low power monitoring nodes.
