Overview
-------
This is a very simple soldering kit to build a solar powered torch.
The unit has a small solar panel which recharges an ultra-capacitor.
There are two LEDs, one white and one red, which are powered by the energy in the ultra-capacitor.

The ultra-capacitor is 0.47F which stores enough charge for around 20 minutes of white light, or around 1 hour of red light.

This kit is designed as a **"Learn to Solder"** kit and as an introduction to **solar power**.

This kit can also be used as a small power supply for other projects (requiring a 3-5.5V power supply). This could be used for very low power monitoring nodes.

Tools Required
--------------

Step 1: Solder Resistors
------------------------

Step 2: Solder Diode
------------------------

Step 3: Solder Switches
------------------------

Step 4: Solder Capacitor
------------------------

Step 5: Solder LEDs
------------------------

Step 6: Solder PV Cell
------------------------
The PV cell is actually a module comprised of a number of small solar PV cells. This unit has a maximum output of 5.5V and a maximum current of ***mA.
The solar cell is attached to the back of the PCB and so will cover the soldering already done - please **double check** your soldering here and ensure there are not any bad connections or solder short circuits.



Step 7: Attach Keyring
------------------------

Step 8: Finished!
------------------------
Place the unit in bright sunlight for a while (at least 10mins).
When pressed, the switches should control each LED.

Going Further
----------------------
This unit is also designed to be used as a solar power unit for very low power applications. Connections to P4 are to the terminals of the ultra-capacitor and these can be used to power other projects.
Remember that the voltage can vary from 0V (when totally discharged) up to 5.3V (when totally charged). The attached circuit must be able to withstand this range of voltages.
